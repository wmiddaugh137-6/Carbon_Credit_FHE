# Carbon_Credit_FHE

A privacy-preserving carbon credit management platform utilizing Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to enable secure computation over encrypted environmental and trading data. The system allows carbon market participants ‚Äî corporations, verifiers, and regulators ‚Äî to perform audits, calculate emissions, and verify offsets without ever revealing the raw data itself.

---

## Overview

In the rapidly expanding carbon credit market, transparency and trust are crucial. Yet, organizations are often reluctant to share sensitive data such as production metrics or emission details due to confidentiality concerns. Traditional auditing systems require access to plaintext data, creating a conflict between privacy and verifiability.

**Carbon_Credit_FHE** bridges this gap by applying **Fully Homomorphic Encryption**, a cryptographic breakthrough that allows computations on encrypted data. With FHE, emissions and credits can be processed securely ‚Äî the results remain valid, but the input data is never exposed.

This project aims to establish a decentralized and verifiable carbon accounting framework that ensures privacy, trust, and compliance.

## Key Features

### üîí Privacy-Preserving Computation

- **FHE-based Calculations:** Enables emission tracking, offset verification, and credit matching directly over encrypted datasets.  
- **Data Confidentiality:** All sensitive metrics remain private ‚Äî even validators and system operators cannot view the underlying values.  
- **End-to-End Encryption:** From submission to computation and output, data is never decrypted.  

### üåø Transparent & Auditable System

- **Verifiable Computations:** Results can be cryptographically verified for correctness.  
- **Immutable Records:** Carbon transactions and verifications are stored immutably on the ledger.  
- **Public Transparency Layer:** Aggregated statistics are published without revealing entity-level data.  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Flexible Architecture

- **Modular Smart Contracts:** Manage carbon credit issuance, trading, and auditing logic.  
- **Encrypted Data Pipeline:** Integrates with FHE-enabled computation nodes for secure data processing.  
- **Adaptive Policy Engine:** Supports customizable carbon accounting rules across jurisdictions.

## Why FHE Matters

Conventional encryption protects data at rest and in transit, but once data needs to be analyzed, it must be decrypted ‚Äî exposing it to potential leaks.  
Fully Homomorphic Encryption revolutionizes this model:

1. **Compute on Ciphertexts:** Perform emissions summations, credit balances, or compliance checks without ever decrypting the input.  
2. **Preserve Privacy:** Even auditors, regulators, or smart contracts cannot access plaintext data.  
3. **Guarantee Integrity:** Results are mathematically guaranteed to be correct and verifiable.  

This means carbon footprint verification, offset validation, and credit reconciliation can be automated securely and transparently, without revealing corporate secrets.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

**1. FHE Computation Layer**  
Handles encrypted operations such as carbon footprint calculations, emission offset matching, and total credit aggregation. Uses homomorphic addition and multiplication circuits optimized for environmental data models.

**2. Blockchain Smart Contracts**  
Manages the lifecycle of credits ‚Äî issuance, transfer, and retirement ‚Äî ensuring traceability and immutability. Contracts store encrypted proofs, not plaintext values.

**3. Data Oracle & Gateway**  
Provides encrypted data feeds from certified auditors or IoT sensors. Gateways encrypt input data client-side before submitting to the FHE computation layer.

**4. User Interface**  
A web dashboard allowing participants to view encrypted credit balances, verification proofs, and aggregate environmental impact metrics ‚Äî all without revealing private data.

## Technology Stack

**Core Technologies**

- **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE):** Primary cryptographic backbone enabling private computations.  
- **Solidity & Smart Contracts:** Secure, immutable carbon credit record management.  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Optional verification layer ensuring FHE computations are valid.  
- **React + TypeScript:** Frontend application for interactive dashboards and secure submissions.  
- **Node.js Services:** Backend logic for handling encryption, data batching, and oracle integration.

## Workflow

1. **Data Submission:**  
   Each participant encrypts their emission data locally using an FHE key pair.  

2. **Encrypted Processing:**  
   The platform performs necessary calculations (e.g., total CO‚ÇÇ emissions, offset validations) directly on encrypted data.  

3. **Proof Generation:**  
   A cryptographic proof of correctness is generated and recorded on-chain.  

4. **Result Decryption (Optional):**  
   Only authorized entities may decrypt final outcomes when required, without accessing any raw data.

## Security Principles

- **Zero Exposure:** Raw data never leaves the user‚Äôs control in plaintext.  
- **Mathematical Integrity:** Computation results are provably correct via FHE and ZKP guarantees.  
- **Decentralized Verification:** Multiple validators confirm proof validity, eliminating trust in a single party.  
- **Immutable Ledger:** All computation proofs and transaction records are permanently verifiable.  

---

## Use Cases

- **Corporate Carbon Accounting:** Enables companies to report verified emission totals without revealing production data.  
- **Cross-Organization Auditing:** Allows third-party auditors to verify compliance without data access.  
- **Governmental Oversight:** Regulators can analyze industry-level statistics securely.  
- **Sustainable Finance:** Banks can assess carbon-neutral commitments using encrypted proof-based scoring.
